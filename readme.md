# SeqHighway

SeQHighway is a python library to visualize biological annotated sequences, e.g. from genbank files, in HTML / CSS.

![](example/seqhighway.html.pdf.png)

Given a Biopython SeqRecord as input (for example parsed from a genbank file), SeqHighway will generate an HTML representation by using pure HTML/CSS (with optionaly some svg graphics) of the sequence with overlay annotations.

floating annotations : CDS

clear layout even with overlapping features

overlay annotations of sequence regions by changing background color, font weight, etc.

CDS with optional translated protein sequence

## Examples of use



## Future improvements

- HTML representation of sequence alignments
